# AutoRegret

A self-modifying frontend app experiment powered by GPT-4 and a virtual file system. See `AutoRegret-Spec.md` for full details and architecture.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no backend required).
3. The floating panel UI will appear; the user app loads in the main area.

---

- All code is client-side only.
- App code and history are stored in IndexedDB.
- Use the floating panel to chat, edit, and view diffs.

**Warning:** This is a prototype and will mutate itself. See the spec for limitations and safety notes.
